# Novetus
A multi-version ROBLOX client launcher built to allow the user to run LAN and Internet servers.

Note that this is an *unofficial fork* of the original Novetus source code, created by Bitl which is available [here](https://github.com/Novetus/Novetus_src). I just am too lazy to create a custom name for this repository. This is a repository for me to tinker with Novetus.

## Building
Use Visual Studio 2019
